# RealDeUr-UNIFEI
My project for college, the board game Royal Game Of Ur, write in C and displayed in the windows console.

The game is in portuguese, but I think the game is intuitive enough.

## Complie

You only need compile one of the RealDeUR-X.0.c files, with the RealBot.c file if X >= 4. Example:
 ```shell
gcc RealDeUr-5.0.c RealBot.c -o RealDeUr-5.0.exe
```
